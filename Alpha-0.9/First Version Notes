To have alpha version 0.9 work you must have all of these programs in the same folder, but you only have to run IGUI.java
You will notice that the JFrame of the application still has the calendar and mail functions missing. 
These will be added in the Beta update.
The website blocker will only work on OSX due to the fact it uses SelfControl and SelfControl is a OSX-native app.
To make the website blocker work, you must download SelfControl. Their website is here: http://selfcontrolapp.com/ 
On OSX there are plans to make the program download SelfControl automatically, but that function will not be implemented until full release 1.0

Good Luck with Everyday and tell us what problems there are with it. Thanks.
